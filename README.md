## 01 - Introduction to OpenAI API

For the first chapter I used Jupyter Notebooks.

Jupyter is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It supports multiple programming languages, including Python, R, and Julia. To use Jupyter, you need to first install it on your computer and launch it in your web browser. Once you have Jupyter running, you can create a new notebook, write and execute code, add text and images, and save and share your work. Jupyter notebooks are a powerful tool for data analysis, scientific computing, and education, and can help you streamline your workflow and collaborate with others.

### Installation

You can install Jupyter Notebooks with the following command:

```bash
brew install jupyter
```

Navigate to the 01 folder and run the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
